# First Instance Dropper Plugin for RuneLite
## Description

The First Instance Dropper is a RuneLite plugin that modifies the default item-dropping behavior in Old School RuneScape (OSRS). Instead of dropping the exact item you click on, this plugin will drop the first instance of that item found in your inventory.

## Features

- Intercepts all "Drop" actions in your inventory
- Drops the first instance of the clicked item type, rather than the specific item clicked
- Seamlessly integrates with the existing RuneLite interface

## Installation

1. Ensure you have the latest version of RuneLite installed.
2. Open RuneLite and navigate to the Plugin Hub.
3. Search for "First Instance Dropper" in the search bar.
4. Click the toggle switch next to the plugin name to enable it.

## Usage

Once installed and enabled, the plugin works automatically:

1. Open your inventory in OSRS.
2. Right-click on any item and select "Drop" as you normally would.
3. The plugin will intercept this action and drop the first instance of that item type found in your inventory.

Note: The visual feedback in the game will still show you dropping the item you clicked on, but the actual item dropped will be the first instance of that type in your inventory.

## Configuration

Currently, this plugin does not have any configurable options. It works out of the box with no additional setup required.

## Compatibility

This plugin is compatible with the latest version of RuneLite and OSRS. If you encounter any issues, please ensure both RuneLite and the plugin are up to date.

## Feedback and Bug Reports

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please submit them on our GitHub repository or through the RuneLite Discord channel.
